    "To calculate the probability of winning the grand prize, we can use the concept of combinations. The total number of ways to choose 6 numbers out of 51 is given by the combination formula \n",

    "Thankfully, there's a function for this to reduce human error. This function uses the comb function from the math module to calculate the total number of combinations for selecting 6 numbers out of 51. The probability of winning is then the reciprocal of this total number of combinations, as there is only one specific combination that results in a win."
